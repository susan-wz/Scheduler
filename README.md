# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a simple, single page app that allows users to book interviews in appointment slots. I worked on this project during week 7 and 8 of the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. We were given CSS and some starter code for this project so we could focus on learning React, Storybook, and using different testing libraries: Jest and Cypress. 

I have also hosted a version with the database on Heroku (https://swz-scheduler.herokuapp.com/api/*) and the client app on Netlify (https://swz-scheduler.netlify.com/). 

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.
Run the scheduler-api.

## Running Webpack Development Server

```sh
npm start
```
The app will run on localhost:8000. 

## Running Jest Test Framework

```sh
npm test
```

## Running Storybook Visual Testbed

```sh
npm run storybook
```
